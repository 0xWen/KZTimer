=======

- added client commands !ljblock and !flashlight
- added longjump block stats

--> how to port jumpstats data from the old table into the new table: 
1. install the new version of kztimer
2. start the server and stop it then again (kztimer  creates automatically the new db table playerjumpstats3)
3. use navicat lite (or some other db front end) and export the data from playerjumpstats2 into a .txt file. (format doenst matter)
4. Afterwards u have to import the file in playerjumpstats3 --> DONE
