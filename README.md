Alliedmodders kztimer thread: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=223274

Info: 
- KZTimer is designed as Kreedz/Climb plugin!
- tickrate 102.4 is optimal for kreedzing (start parameter: -tickrate 102.4)
- The point system is based on the mapcycle.txt of cs:go. That is why you should keep your mapcycle always up to date!
- keep also your database clean and delete player times from maps which are not longer in your mapcycle because map records on those maps are still counted in the top pro/tp climbers list (!resetmaptimes <map>)
- datatable warnings are harmless
- Log "error": [SDKTOOLS] "FindEntityByClassname" not supported by this mod, falling back to IServerTools method.

- KZ AntiCheat is automatically disabled when kz_auto_bhop is set to 1
- globalconnections.sp doenst contain the correct login data
- Global map record requirements (Global record top5 appears on all servers which are using KZ Timer):
>kz_checkpoints_on_bhop_plattforms 0, kz_auto_timer 0, kz_settings_enforcer 1 and
>only kz_, bkz_ and xc_ maps with integrated climb buttons are supported

- Known bug:
The prestrafe method doenst work for a very (very very!) small amount of players. Reason: Unkown and probably on cliend-side

Changelog
=======

v1.44
- changed global database login (new host ip)
- database admin commands requires root flag now

v1.43
- added <"SET NAMES  'utf8'"> (global database)
- divided kz_replay_bot_skin in kz_replay_tpbot_skin and kz_replay_probot_skin
- divided kz_replay_bot_arm_skin in kz_replay_tpbot_arm_skin and kz_replay_probot_arm_skin
- added colors tags in all center/hint messages

v1.42
- added cfg/sourcemod/kztimer/main.cfg (these server cvars were hard-coded) (don't forget to add this file. very important!)
- moved the map type configs to cfg/sourcemod/kztimer/map_types/ (u have to update your folder structure!)
- added server cvar kz_info_bot: provides information about nextmap and timeleft in his player name
- added server cvar kz_recalc_top100_on_mapstart: on/off - starts a recalculation of top 100 player ranks at map start.
- added server cvar kz_pro_mode: (!) EXPERIMENTAL (!) on/off - jump penalty, prespeed cap at 300.0, own global top, prestrafe and server settings which feels much more 
like in 1.6. This makes maps which requires multibhops (> 280 units) impossible. Also only tickrate 102.4 supported

- Afterwards u have to import the file in playerjumpstats3 --> DONE
